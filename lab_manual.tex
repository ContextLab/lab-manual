\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:intro} % Adding an asterisk leaves out this chapter from the table of contents
This lab manual is intended to provide a crash course in doing
research in the Contextual Dynamics Lab.  It introduces our general research
approach and some basic lab policies.

\newthought{Who is this lab manual for?}  \marginnote{\texttt{TASK:}
  Upon reading through this lab manual for the first time, please make
  at least one edit.  You could correct a typo, clarify something
  that's unclear, add a comment, etc.  Importantly, be sure to push
  your edits to the manual's
  \href{https://bitbucket.org/manning3/lab-manual}{Bitbucket
    repository} so that everyone can benefit.} Every new lab member
should read the latest version of this lab manual in detail and
reference it later as needed.  Periodically throughout the document,
you will see margin notes with listed \texttt{TASK} items.  Completing
your read through entails both reading the contents of the manual and
completing the relevant \texttt{TASK} items.

\newthought{What should you do if you don't understand something?}
\marginnote{\texttt{TIP:} If you don't understand something, ask
  another lab member for help!}If you don't understand something you
read in this manual, it is important that you \textit{ask another lab
  member for help}.  Every member of the lab brings their own unique
knowledge base, training, life experiences, and perspectives.
Respecting and celebrating those differences drives the science we do.
If you're new to the lab or new to a particular technique, you might
feel like a newbie today--- but chances are good that if you stick
around for a bit someone else will be seeking your expert opinion
before you know it.  In addition to learning, there's another good
reason for asking for help: if you don't understand something, there's
a reasonable chance that you've discovered a mistake or a logical
inconsistency!

\newthought{Why is it worth my time to read through the manual?}
Aside from pursuing your own curiosity, a major reason that you've
decided to join an academic research lab is probably because you want
to gain training or career-advancing experiences.  This manual briefly
summarizes the collective wisdom of past and present lab members in a
way that we think will best allow you to achieve your objectives.
\textit{Learn from it}, \textit{challenge it}, and \textit{add to it}.

\newthought{What ``isn't'' this lab manual?}
This lab manual is
\textit{not} intended to provide a comprehensive overview of
everything you need to know to do your research projects.  As
described next, you may not even \textit{know} what you need to know
to do your projects!  Nevertheless, you need somewhere to start, and
this is that place.




\chapter{Official lab practices and policies}\label{ch:policy}
Our lab's practices and policies are intended to provide a framework
for \textit{maximizing efficiency}.  Achieving our peak efficiency as
a lab means we are being as scientifically productive as possible, in
terms of knowledge discovery (learning new stuff) and disemination
(papers, talks, conference presentations, publicly released datasets,
software, etc.). It also means that our fellow lab members are
achieving their training and career objectives.  To achieve peak
efficiency we need to succeed on three fronts:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Communication.}  We want to foster an environment where
  everyone feels comfortable contributing to the collective dialogue.
  Our lab meets regularly to discuss logistical (e.g.\ scheduling, financial,
  sociological) and technical issues.  We also use a variety of
  software packages to synchronize and facilitate communication within
  our lab and between our lab and the broader scientific community.
\item \textbf{Resource allocation.}  Our lab resources (e.g.\
  equipment, time, money, attention) are finite.  We want to foster an
  environment where lab resources are used as efficiently as possible
  to achieve our collective goals.  We also want to foster
  sustainable use of resources by regularly pursuing research funding opportunities.
\item \textbf{Adaptability.}  The whole point of \textit{research} is that we
  don't already know the answer to the questions we're exploring or
  how to make the tools we're working on.  That means that we won't
  necessarily be able to plan out everything in advance.  We often need to
  be focused and efficient \textit{without knowing the end goal}!
\end{itemize}
Your job as a contributing lab member is to help us to achieve our
collective peak efficiency (as a lab) while also maximizing your own
training and career potential.  To do this, the Contextual Dynamics
Lab practices \textbf{agile science}, as described in the next section.

\newpage
\section{The Agile Science Approach}
The Agile Science approach used in the Contextual Dynamics Lab is
inspired by the Agile Movement in the software development world.  The
fundamental idea is to respond to unpredictability in research through
incremental, iterative work ``sprints.''  This is different from
traditional approaches, where a project team might try to plan out
every part of a project in advance.  We do try to break projects into
tiny bite-sized chunks, but the key is that we only need to know what
the \textit{next} chunk is.  Although it's helpful to have a general
sense of where things are going, we never actually need to know where
the project will ultimately end up.  The goals and process are
constantly evolving.

There are \href{http://www.agilemanifesto.org/principles.html}{twelve
  principles} behind our approach:\marginnote{\texttt{TASK:} Watch the
  \href{http://scrumtrainingseries.com/}{Scrum Training Series videos}.  While watching, mentally replace
  ``software'' with ``software, papers, and posters.''  (Note:
  ``Scrum'' is an implementation of the agile process.)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Our highest priority is to benefit the research community
  through the early and continuous delivery of documentation (papers,
  presentations) and tools (software and devices).

\item Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.  Agile
  processes harness change to gain a competitive advantage.

\item Deliver working software and papers frequently, from a couple of
  weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter
  timescale.

\item Researchers in different roles must work together daily
  throughout the project.

\item Build projects around motivated individuals.  Give them the
  environment and support they need and trust them to get the job
  done.

\item The most effective and efficient method of conveying information
  to and within a research team is face-to-face conversation.

\item The product itself (software, paper, poster,
  presentation, grant) is the primary measure of progress.

\item Agile science promotes sustainable research.  Researchers should
  be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

\item Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
  enhances agility.

\item Simplicity---the art of maximizing the amount of work not
  done---is essential.

\item The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from
  self-organizing teams.

\item At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more
  effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Projects roles}
Every project has just three roles.  You will play one or more of
these roles on each project:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Project Owner.}  This is the person responsible for
  maximizing ``return on investment'' of the project effort:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Responsible for project vision
\item Constantly re-prioritizes the research backlog, adjusting any
  long-term expectations such as publication and release plans
\item Final arbiter of requirements questions
\item Accepts or rejects each project increment
\item Decides whether to publish/ship the project
\item Decides whether to continue development
\item Considers interests of funding bodies (e.g. NIH, NSF, DARPA,
  private organizations) and the scientific community
\item May contribute as a team member
\item Has a leadership role
\item Usually the project owner will be Jeremy
\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Team Member.}  Team members are responsible for carrying
  out the project work.  Team members are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Cross-functional: includes members with development skills
  (write code or papers/grants), testing skills (e.g.\ test software,
  proofread papers/grants), and/or domain expertise (e.g.\ knowledge
  or interest in a relevant research area)
\item Self-organizing and self-managing without externally assigned
  roles
\item Negotiates commitments with the Project Owner, one ``sprint'' at
  a time
\item Has autonomy regarding how to reach commitments
\item Intensely collaborative
\item (Ideally) located in one team room (usually this will be the lab)
\item (Ideally) committed to long-term, full-time lab membership
\item (Ideally) members of a single team/project
\item Has a leadership role
\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Project Coordinator}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Facilitates the agile science process
\item Helps resolve impediments
\item Creates an environment conducive to team self-organization
\item Captures empirical data to adjust forecasts
\item Shields the team from external interference and distraction to
  keep it ``in the zone''
\item Enforces timelines
\item Has no management authority over the team (anyone with authority
  over the team is by definition not its Project
  Coordinator)\marginnote{NOTE: we do not currently have a dedicated
    Lab Coordinator, so Jeremy is playing that role.  Therefore the
    Project Coordinator role is less ``pure'' than in a traditional agile
    approach.  The intended role description is outlined here, but in
    practice the Project Coordinator role may have management
    authority until we have a dedicated Lab Coordinator.}
\item Has a leadership role
\item Usually the Lab Coordinator will also be the Project Coordinator
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

%\newpage
\section{Getting started in the lab}
The very first thing you need to do is to create three accounts that
will enable you to interact with the rest of the lab, download and use
the lab's software packages, and accomplish various necessary
administrative tasks:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \href{https://context-lab.slack.com}{\textbf{Slack.}}  This is where
  almost all not-in-person lab communications take place.  It provides
  an interface for asking questions, storing notes, and sharing
  ideas.  If you have an @dartmouth.edu email address, you can create
  an account.  Otherwise you'll need to get invited by the Lab Coordinator.

\item \href{https://www.trello.com}{\textbf{Trello.}}  This is used to
  manage all projects and tasks.  It provides a way of tracking
  progress and imediments to progress.  You'll need to sign up for a
  free account and then have the Lab Coordinator invite you to the
  lab's Trello Team.

\item \href{https://www.bitbucket.org}{\textbf{BitBucket.}}  This is
  used to manage all code, papers, grants, presentations, and
  posters.  In other words, anything where it'd be useful to track
  multiple versions, anything that we might ultimately want to release
  to the public, and/or anything that multiple lab members will be
  collaborating on.  Each project has one or more BitBucket repositories.
\end{enumerate}

Once you've created those accounts (and once you've been invited to
the lab-specific team on Trello), you can start working through the
\href{https://trello.com/b/Mgs45iEJ/lab-setup}{Lab Setup Trello
  Board}.  You can ask any questions through Slack (use the \href{https://context-lab.slack.com/messages/general/}{\#general
channel} or the channel specific your project).


\section{Starting a new project}
Our lab uses a number of project management tools and policies to
promote continuity across projects and lab members.  To start a new
project, follow the steps
\href{https://trello.com/b/s4L8fbot/initiate-a-project}{here}.

%\newpage
\section{Joining a project}
To join a project, simply subscribe to the project's Slack channel and
update the
\href{https://trello.com/b/IWQ00r69/project-staffing-collaborators}{Project
  Staffing \& Collaborators} board on Trello.  All project
communications should occur through Slack, whenever possible.  This
keeps notes searchable and visible to all team members (except direct
messages, which are useful for private communications between one or
more team members).


\section{Meetings}
Effective lab communication requires forums for communicating.  As
described above, we use Slack to facilitate non-in-person
communications, but Slack cannot replace in-person meetings.
%http://scrumtrainingseries.com/BacklogRefinementMeeting/BacklogRefinementMeeting.htm


\section{Scheduling}
Complex dynamic systems can be difficult to understand (e.g.\
describe, compute with).  Fortunately for us, we do not need to start
entirely from scratch with respect to attempting to organize some
complex dynamic system we care about in our lab.  For example, we can
use tools like calendars and other software packages to organize and
understand our own temporal dynamics.  Our lab's scheduling policies
are intended to facilitate lab member interactions between ourselves,
our collaborators, and our experimental participants.  There are three
basic tools the lab uses to organize and schedule events:
\begin{itemize}
\item \href{http://calendar.google.com}{Google Calendar}.  We use the
  main lab calendar to keep track of lab-wide events including lab
  meetings, conferences, important talks.  We use the DHMC events
  calendar to keep track of important events and meetings at the
  DHMC.  We use the out-of-lab calendar to keep track of known
  absenses (e.g. illness, travel, holidays, etc.).  We use the
  meetings calendar to keep track of scheduled meetings (regularly
  scheduled meetings with Jeremy or senior lab members, project
  meetings, etc.).  When you add an event, it is important to include
  the following information as a comment (this does not apply to ``out-of-lab'' events):
\begin{itemize}
  \item Key contact names and contact information (email or phone)
  \item Physical address (where the event will take place)
  \item A brief description of the event and/or other relevant information
  \item Attach any relevant documents via Google Docs
\end{itemize}
\item \href{http://www.doodle.com}{Doodle} and
  \href{http://www.when2meet.com}{When2Meet}.  We use Doodle and
  When2Meet to converge on mutually good meeting times that fit (as
  well as possible) with everyone's busy schedules.  Doodle is most
  useful for selecting a date from a large number of options, and
  When2Meet is most useful for selecting a specfic time on a
  relatively small number of dates.
\end{itemize}

 \subsection{Attendance policy}
 We abide by a ``common sense'' attendance policy that relies on an
 honor system.  If you cannot attend a lab event or meeting, your
 privacy will be respected: you do not (generally speaking) need to
 provide a reason for your absense (although you are honor bound not
 to abuse this system!)-- but you are expected to responsibly manage
 your schedule so that you get your work done and minimize
 inconvenience to others to the extent possible.  The one exception is
 that if you seem to be abusing this system (as determined by your
 project owner or project coordinator), you may be asked to provide
 additional information (in a way that does not invade your privacy--
 and if you are worried that this policy is overly intrusive, please
 bring your concerns to Jeremy or the Lab Coordinator).  Here's the
 official lab attendance policy:
\begin{itemize}
\item It is your responsibility to notify anyone your absense will
  affect (e.g. people you're scheduled to meet with, etc.).  The best
  way to do this is via email or Slack.  We also use an ``out-of-lab''
  calendar to keep track of things like vacations or longer planned absences.

\item If you are feeling sick, \textit{do not come into the lab}.  We can
  arrange virtual meetings (if you are feeling well enough) or
  re-schedule as needed.  The health and safety of the lab is the top
  priority.

\item If you need to be out of the lab for an unexpected non-illness-related
  emergency, simply give as much notice and information as possible.

\item You are expected to attend all lab meetings and other regularly
  scheduled meetings that are directly relevant to your work in the
  lab.

\item If you are scheduled to present at a conference (i.e.\ you
  submit an abstract and the abstract is accepted as a talk or
  poster), you are expected to attend the conference to present your
  work.

\item You are strongly encouraged (but never required) to attend
  relevant journal clubs, PBS talks, DHMC
  meetings and talks, thesis defenses, and other relevant lab and/or
  Dartmouth-affiliated events.  If you are overwhelmed with other
  work, have a conflicting meeting, are running an experimental
  participant, or are out of the lab for other reasons, you do not
  need to provide a reason for your absense (unless you're presenting
  or are otherwise playing a key role).
\end{itemize}


 \section{Lab finances}
 As with most academic research labs, we (sadly!) must conduct our
 research within a limited research budget.  In practice, the
 important thing is to communicate with Jeremy and/or the Lab
 Coordinator before you spend (or commit to spending) lab funds.

 Generally, the lab's financial policy is the following: we will do
 whatever is possible to ensure you have the equipment and resources
 you \textit{need} to do your best work.  If you can adequately
 justify an expense and sufficient funds are available, then we will
 spend what it takes to get the job done.  If you cannot justify an
 expense, or if the lab does not have sufficient funds, then we will
 need to get creative by figuring out how to get the job done anyway
 on a seemingly too-small budget.  Usually we'll find ourselves
 somewhere in the middle of this continuum, which will help us to
 stretch our limited budget as far as possible while not making
 ourselves crazy or losing too much productivity in the process.

 Some of our projects are intended to be self-funded and/or to support
 other projects (e.g.\ StockProphet).  Any use of project-generated
 funds should be discussed with Jeremy and/or the Lab Coordinator.

 \subsection{Computers}
All lab members need a computer to get their work done.  We generally
prefer to use Macs, as this maximizes compatibility across lab
members.  Depending on your expected role in the lab and the specifics
of your project, the lab may provide a computer to you, or you may be
expected to use your personal computer to complete your work.  Any
equipment purchased by the lab, including personal computers, is the
official property of the Contextual Dynamics Lab and should be treated
as such.  All equipment must be returned to the lab when your
association with the lab is complete.

In addition to personal computers, we also maintain a lab account on
Dartmouth's Discovery Supercomputing Cluster.  We use Discovery for
our most computationally intensive work.  The
\href{https://trello.com/b/Mgs45iEJ/lab-setup}{Lab Setup Trello Board}
contains instructions for creating an account and accessing the
Discovery cluster.  Our suggested workflow is to do
non-intensive computations and analyses on your personal desktop or
laptop computer, and to offload more intensive analyses to Discovery.
The lab's code repository includes sample MATLAB scripts for
submitting analyses to Discovery.

 \subsection{Other research equipment}
Many research projects require specialized research equipment
(e.g.\ for neuroimaging using fMRI, EEG, ECoG, etc.).  Some of the
necessary research equipment is owned by the Contextual Dynamics Lab,
and other equipment is shared with other labs or with PBS.  All
equipment should be treated with care and respect.  Any malfunctions
should be reported immediately.

 \subsection{Travel policy}
 A major component of doing scientific research is communicating with
 other scientists.  The Contextual Dynamics Lab regularly presents at
 several international scientific conferences.  If you are presenting
 your work (i.e., you are the presenting author for a talk or poster),
 then your travel expenses and conference registration fees will be
 guaranteed by the lab, under the assumption that you will also make
 reasonable efforts to seek out alternative sources of travel funding
 (e.g.\ through PBS, other internal Dartmouth sources, apply for
 travel awards, use personal grants like NRSAs or NSF fellowships,
 etc.).  You are also expected to keep costs low (e.g.\ fly economy
 class, seek out cheaper tickets, stay in reasonably priced hotels,
 share a room with other lab members, etc.).  By the same token, we
 also want to be cognizant of your comfort and time, and it is not
 always necessary to use the cheapest option.  More specific travel
 guidelines will be given on a per-conference or per-trip basis.

If you are not presenting your work, but you are a full-time graduate student,
postdoctoral reseracher, or lab coordinator, then the lab will cover
your travel expenses to a limited number of conferences each year.
These should be discussed with Jeremy.

If you are an undergraduate research not presenting your work, the lab
will generally not pay for you to attend conferences.  However, if you
are interested in attending a conference, and you aren't able to
secure funding through non-lab sources, you should discuss your
options with Jeremy.

 \subsection{Poster printing}
There are two on-campus poster printers.  One is maintained through
the Thayer School of Engineering.  More information may be found
\href{http://kb.thayer.dartmouth.edu/article/286-printing}{here}.
This is the preferred printing method, as it is free to use.  The
second on-campus option is to use the Map Room through the Baker
Library.  More information may be found
\href{http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/maproom/printingfaq.html}{here}.
This is a relatively low-cost option, and is sometimes more convenient
than using Thayer's printer.


 \subsection{Publication costs}
All costs related to lab publications will be fully covered by the
lab.  The Lab Coordinator can help facilitate these payments.

 \subsection{Subject payments}
 Subject payments for lab reseach projects will be fully covered by
 the lab.  Subject payment guidelines are generally found in the IRB
 approval documentation relevant to your project.  For Mechanical Turk
 experiments, a subject payments budget should be approved prior to
 beginning the experiment.
