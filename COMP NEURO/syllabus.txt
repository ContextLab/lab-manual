Topics in Computational Neuroscience




This course explores the use of computers in modern psychological and neuroscientific research.  The course is divided into two parts.  In part 1, we will examine what it means to construct computational models of brain systems, and ask how those models can be used to gain insights into those systems.  In part 2, we will examine techniques for analyzing data from neuroscientific experiments.  Students will learn basic programming in MATLAB, and will learn how to use MATLAB to create neuroscientific models and analyze real (and simulated) neuroscientific data.

Course goals:
    
Students will learn how to use computers to simulate, explore, and analyze neuroscientific data.  In particular they will:

    a.) Learn to design and implement neural and psychological models in MATLAB.  Students will read real scientific papers and learn to translate concepts in those papers into computer code.
    
    b.) Learn key techniques in the analysis of human brain data.  Students will analyze real neuroscientific datasets, from real experiments.

Prerequisites:

Students should have taken Psychology 6 and at least one 20-level course prior to taking this course.  These courses will provide a general framework for 

Grading:
     30%: Problem sets help to enforce material learned in class.  Students may work in groups of up to 3 people (everyone must hand in their own problem set and indicate who was in their group).  Graded on a six point scale (5 problem sets total; each worth 6% of final grade).
     10%: Reading responses (brief responses to each reading, submitted online before class; graded as 1 point if you did it and 0 if you didn't)
     20%: Midterm exam (will be similar to "thought questions" from problem sets).
     30%: Final paper/project
     10%: Participantion: be a regular contributor to in-class discussions and/or online piazza forum.

     + Final paper (15 pages):
       Option 1: pick favorite topic from the course, do a literature review, and write a "grant application" describing the experiments and analyses you would do to
       Option 2: pick a problem set from the course.  Extend the model (or technique) in some interesting way and write about what you did, why you did it, and what you found.
